<p align="justify">Specific gravity of the soil solids is useful in the determination of void-ratio, degree of saturation, etc., besides the &lsquo;Critical Hydraulic gradient&rsquo;, and &lsquo;Zero-air-voids&rsquo; in compaction. It is useful in computing the unit weight of the soil under different conditions and also in the determination of particle size by wet analysis. Hence, the specific gravity of soil solids should be determined with great precision. It is defined as the ratio of the mass of unit volume of soil at a stated temperature to the mass of the same volume of gas-free distilled water at a stated temperature.</p>
